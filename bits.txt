1) converting binary to decimal
2) converting decimal to binary
3) Operators ->
    a) and -> all one => one    
              all zero => zero

    b) or -> any one => one 
             all zero => zero

    c) xor -> even one -> zero  
              odd one -> one
       xor of two number is zero if and only if both numbers are same
       xor of any number with zero number itself

    d) shift Operators
        * right shift operator (>>) 
            eg 5 >> 2  removes the 2 rightmost bits in the decimal representation of 5 which simplies means it gives a number which is equal to 5/(pow(2,2));
            in general decimal >> x gives decimal/(2^x)
        * left shift operator (<<)
            eg 5 << 2 removes the 2 leftmost bits in the decimal representation of 5 which simplies means it gives a number which is equal to 5 * (pow(2,2));
            in general decimal << 2 gives decimal * (2^x)
